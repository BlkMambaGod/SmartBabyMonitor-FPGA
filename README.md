# BabyGuardian-FPGA
**Real-time Infant Safety Monitoring System using FPGA**

## Overview
BabyGuardian-FPGA is a **real-time embedded system** designed to monitor the **health, safety, and environment** of an infant.  
Developed as part of the **GEN1243 – Conception de systèmes digitaux** course at **UQO (Automne 2025)**, this project demonstrates the use of a **CPLD/FPGA-based controller** for critical monitoring and automation tasks.

The system measures vital signs and environmental parameters to help **prevent Sudden Infant Death Syndrome (SIDS)** and alert parents when dangerous conditions are detected.

## Objectives
1. Monitor vital signs: body temperature, heart rate, oxygen saturation, movement.  
2. Track environmental factors: room temperature, humidity, and smoke detection.  
3. Automatically trigger safety actions (fan, heater, alarms).  
4. Send real-time alerts to a mobile device (optional IoT extension).  
5. Demonstrate real-time control and synchronization on FPGA hardware.

## Validation & Testing
- Functional and timing simulations in Quartus/ModelSim.  
- Hardware testing with live sensor inputs.  
- Real-time monitoring validation under various conditions.  
- Debugging via waveform analysis and logical probe testing.
